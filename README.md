# Horiseon Refactoring - Module 1 Assignment

### Background:

This project worked to refactor the source code to follow accessibility standards so that the client's website is optimized for search engines.

### Description of Changes:

The existing code for the Horiseon webpage was improved in several ways, including:
* labeling HTML elements to follow proper semantics making the source code easily comprehensible and accessible
* organizing elements of HTML, such as the header, main content, sections, aside, and footer, to follow a logical structure
* adding alt attributes such as image descriptions to allow for accessibility when viewing icon and image elements as well as searcg engine optimization
* correcting the non-functioning navigation link for the "search engine optimization" button by adding the missing "id" element to the source code so that the link functions properly
* adding spacing to make the source code easy to navigate 
* adding a concise, descriptive title 
* adding comments throughout to highlight edits to the source code
